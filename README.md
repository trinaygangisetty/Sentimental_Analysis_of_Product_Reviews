# Sentimental_Analysis_of_Product_Reviews
DATA MINING FINAL PROJECT

# Abstract
This project investigates consumer preferences and opinions across 15 categories
by using sentiment analysis on over 23,000 womenâ€™s online clothing reviews. The
study classifies sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative based on provided rating values using natural language processing and machine learning models such as
Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines. Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy (95%). The use of visualizations reveals information about sentiment
distribution, positive word frequency, and age group patterns. The findings provide businesses with actionable insights to improve product quality and customer
satisfaction in the e-commerce clothing domain.
